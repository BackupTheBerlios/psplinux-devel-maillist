Hi,
I'm following Linux on PSP since a year now (some breaks due to other 
commitments, though). I see this as a chance to learn more both on the Linux 
kernel and the MIPS arch... I have a CS background but the MIPS introduction 
in the first semester is way to far away ;) so I jump back on it by reading 
"See MIPS run". I did  some Kernel coding but *very* basic stuff.
I don't know if anyone is currently working on the port... I tried to 
understand Jacksons changes, changed a bit the boot sequence to have a root 
filesystem on the memstick, and did some research on porting Linux to MIPS 
(where I found out that some basics in my understanding are missing :)... 

If someone is interested to exchange ideas on PSP Linux, you're welcome... I'm 
having some fun with reading in the meantime

Mik
